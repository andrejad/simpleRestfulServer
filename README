-------------------

Prupose: to have a simple RESTful server and one-table DB for storing 
a predefined records structure fields: "owner" (string), "priority" (int), 
"message" (string), "timestamp" (automatically inserted) and "rowid" (automatically inserted).

Main usage is for collecting the data from the various (Arduino) sensors that can 
put a simple RESTful request, but the scope of usage is wide.

Server will listen on the port 5000. 
List of available methods (help) is at: http://<server_ip>:5000/

For testing purposes, there is a html folder with a simple GUI in 2 php pages. 
These are ready for deployment on Apache. 


srv1.py - Main file of the server, listens on port 5000 for REST/json calls. Start analysis from here.
dbApp.py - Contains DB related actions (CRUD) and creation of the table. 
datastore - Actual data of the SQLite database. Do not change.
mem - bash script for looking at the memory (linux) for python live processes.
run_temp.sh - Bash script for starting the srv1 server. It will stop on Ctrl-C.
run_honup.sh - Bas script for starting the server in production, it will not terminate after logout.
